# IST - Vezba 5

### Notes: 

- You **DO NOT** need to install any dependencies - the node modules folder is **NOT** included in the .gitignore file
- The whole repository **IS NOT** a package / module. It's a folder containing 2 modules ( packages ) and an **app.js** file which tests their functionalities.
